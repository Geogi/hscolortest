#+TITLE: hscolortest README

* Introduction

Developing this simple stand-alone Haskell program helps me understand
how to color output by using =System.Console.Terminfo= (=terminfo=
package).

* Checklist

+ [X] Setup cabal and git
+ [X] Get bold text
+ [X] Get blue text
+ [X] Get bold red text
+ [X] Factor out the formatting work
+ [X] Get automatic formatting of errors
+ [ ] Color output from another module with the least boilerplate
  possible
+ [ ] Add coloring to an existing module with non-intrusive additions
  (e.g. not changing the types, adding some values is OK)
+ [ ] Get it still working (not formatted) if the terminal is not
  capable or terminfo is not present
+ [ ] Add support for a =--no-color= option and infer its use if the
  program is piped
+ [ ] Write a tutorial
