#+TITLE: hscolortest README

* Introduction

Developing this simple stand-alone Haskell program helped me
understand how to color output by using =System.Console.Terminfo=
(=terminfo= package). Currently it works well for my needs so that
repo is on hold.

* Checklist

+ [X] Setup cabal and git
+ [X] Get bold text
+ [X] Get blue text
+ [X] Get bold red text
+ [X] Factor out the formatting work
+ [X] Get automatic formatting of errors
+ [X] Color output from another module with the least boilerplate
  possible
+ [X] Add coloring to an existing module with non-intrusive additions
  (e.g. not changing the types, adding some values is OK)
+ [-] Get it still working (not formatted) if the terminal is not
  capable or terminfo is not present
  + [X] Terminal not capable
  + [ ] No terminfo
+ [ ] Simpler formatted strings building (with operators)
+ [ ] Add support for a =--no-color= option and infer its use if the
  program is piped
+ [ ] Write a tutorial
