#+TITLE: hscolortest README

* Introduction

Developing this simple stand-alone Haskell program helps me understand
how to color output by using `System.Console.Terminfo` (`terminfo`
package).

* Checklist

+ [X] Setup cabal and git
+ [X] Get bold text
+ [X] Get blue text
+ [ ] Get bold blue text
+ [ ] Factor out the formatting work
+ [ ] Color output from another module with the least boilerplate
  possible
+ [ ] Try to see how to add coloring to an existing module with
  non-invasive additions (e.g. not changing the types, adding some
  values is OK)
